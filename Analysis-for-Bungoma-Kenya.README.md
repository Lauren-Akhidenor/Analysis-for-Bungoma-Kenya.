# SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS, FARMING PARCTICES, AND PRODUCTIVITY OF MAIZE FARMERS IN KENYA BUNGOMA COUNTY.

## 📌 INTRODUCTION

Kenya is a geographically diverse country with many agroecological zones (AEZs). Maize (*Zea mays* L.) is a staple food for millions of people in Kenya. The total land area under maize production is approximately 1.5 million hectares, with an average annual output of around 3 million metric tons, yielding a national mean of 2 metric tons per hectare. In the high-potential highlands of Kenya, yields typically range from 4 to 8 T/Ha, representing only 50% (or less) of the genetic potential of hybrid varieties.

Maize production faces numerous constraints, including drought, low soil fertility, pests, and diseases. Foliar and stalk/ear rot diseases, as well as stem borers, significantly impact production in Kenya’s humid transitional and highland regions. Despite breeding advancements, production has not kept pace with population growth. While chemical control methods can help, **host-plant resistance** remains the most economical and sustainable strategy.

This project analyzes survey data from four sub-counties in Bungoma County: **Chwele, Sirisia, Tongaren, and Webuye West**. It aims to understand farming practices, output, training access, and socio-economic characteristics affecting maize production.

#### e) Statistical Analysis

##### i) Trendline Analysis


- **Household Size vs Output**

Figure 1.5: A trendline analysis showing the household size to the estimated output of maize


![Image 11](https://github.com/Lauren-Akhidenor/Analysis-for-Bungoma-Kenya./raw/main/11.png)


Equation: y = 0.7747x + 1.1996, R² = 0.6185


Where,
- m = 0.7747x and, b = 1.1996
- y dependent variable is the estimated output
- x is the independent variable is the household size


Interpretation: 
- For each additional household member, the estimated maize output is expected to increase by 0.7747 units.
- The R² value of 0.6185 suggests a moderate positive correlation.
- The estimated output of maize is 1.1996 when the household size is 0.
 


- **Land Size vs Output**  

Figure 1.6: A trendline Analysis showing the total size of land available to the household in acres to the estimated output of maize.


![Image 12](https://github.com/Lauren-Akhidenor/Analysis-for-Bungoma-Kenya./raw/main/12.png)


Equation: y = 20.317x — 16.015, R² = 0.9865


Where,


- m = 20.317 and, b = -16.015
- y dependent variable is the estimated output
- x is the independent variable is the total size of land available to the household in acres


Interpretation: 
- For each additional acre of land, maize output is expected to increase by 20.317 units.
- The R² value of 0.9865 indicates a very strong positive correlation.
- The estimated output of maize is -16.015 when the total size of land available to the household in acres is 0.



- **Main Plot Size vs Output**

Figure 1.7: Trendline Analysis showing the size of the main/ major maize plot in acres to the estimated output of maize


![Image 13](https://github.com/Lauren-Akhidenor/Analysis-for-Bungoma-Kenya./raw/main/13.png)


Equation: y = 13.5x — 0.375, R² = 0.125


Where,
- m = 13.5 and, b = -0.375
- y dependent variable is the estimated output
- x is the independent variable is the size of the main/ major plot in acres


Interpretation: 
- Each additional acre in the main maize plot is expected to increase output by 13.5 units.
- The R² value of 0.125 suggests that other factors not captured by the model significantly affect maize output.
- The estimated output of maize is -0.375 when the size of the main/ major plot in acres 0. This relatively means there won’t be any form of production or output.
  


##### ii) Regression


- **Years of Farming vs Output:**

Table 1.2 Regression analysis between the years of maize farming and estimated output for all the counties combined.


![Image 14](https://github.com/Lauren-Akhidenor/Analysis-for-Bungoma-Kenya./raw/main/14.png)



Conclusion:
The regression analysis indicates a weak relationship between years of farming and maize output. The number of years farming maize is a weak predictor of output.


- **Total Land Size vs Output:**

![Image 15](https://github.com/Lauren-Akhidenor/Analysis-for-Bungoma-Kenya./raw/main/15.png)


Conclusion:
The regression analysis shows a highly significant and strong positive relationship between land size and maize output, explaining 94.71% of the variation in maize output.



##### iii) Correlation

- **Land Size vs Output:**  


Table 1.4: A correlation table of the estimated output and total size of land


![Image 16](https://github.com/Lauren-Akhidenor/Analysis-for-Bungoma-Kenya./raw/main/16.png)



Conclusion:
A strong positive correlation (approximately 0.97) exists between the total size of land and maize output, indicating that larger land sizes are associated with higher maize yields.



##### iv) T-Test

![Image 17](https://github.com/Lauren-Akhidenor/Analysis-for-Bungoma-Kenya./raw/main/17.png)


- Mean land = 1.97 acres
- mean output = 22.02 units  
- t = -2.1425, p = 0.0342


Conclusion:
Significant relationship, smaller land sizes can produce higher output
